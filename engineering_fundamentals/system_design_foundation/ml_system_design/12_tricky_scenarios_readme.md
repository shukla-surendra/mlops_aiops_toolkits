# Tricky MLOps Scenarios

Fourteen scenario-debugging problems — each a realistic, ambiguous production situation as
it would actually be reported to you (a Slack message, a dashboard anomaly, an angry
stakeholder), not a clean textbook question. This is where the trade-off vocabulary and
failure modes from the eleven tutorials in this section get exercised under the kind of
ambiguity a real incident actually has.

## Why This Format

Design-round questions test whether you can *build* a system. These test whether you can
*reason about one that's already broken* — arguably the harder and more senior skill, and
the one staff+ interview loops increasingly probe directly. Each scenario is structured the
same way:

1. **The Situation** — what you'd actually be told, often vague or slightly misleading
2. **First Questions to Ask** — what you'd clarify before touching anything, since acting
   on an assumption is the most common way candidates go down the wrong path
3. **Likely Root Causes** — ranked hypotheses, not just one "correct" answer
4. **Diagnostic Path** — the concrete steps you'd take to confirm or rule out each
   hypothesis
5. **The Fix** — immediate mitigation vs. the actual long-term fix (these are often
   different, and conflating them is a real interview tell)
6. **Prevention** — the systemic lesson, linked back to the tutorial covering the relevant
   design pattern

## How to Practice These

- **Read only "The Situation" first.** Stop. Say your clarifying questions out loud before
  reading further — this is the step most people skip, and it's the one that separates a
  senior answer from a junior one.
- **Commit to a ranked list of hypotheses before reading "Likely Root Causes."** Compare
  your reasoning, not just your final answer.
- **A given scenario often has more than one contributing cause** — real incidents usually
  do. Resist the urge to stop investigating after finding the first plausible cause.
